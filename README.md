# Capstone-1
My first Springboard's Capstone project

I've joined the Data Analytics Track at Springboard in June 2020.
As part of the program each student should complete two capstone projects.
The first capstone, that I am presenting here, had three phases:
1.	Research and find the dataset to analyze
2.	Analyze the dataset and visualize it
3.	Present the findings
The dataset I have worked on in this capstone, was taken from Kaggle and collected all the movies found on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+ and their IMDb ratings. You can find this dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney.
The Problem Statement I wanted to solve by using insights from analyzing the dataset was: 
What are the opportunities Netflix have, to increase the average ratings of the movies they stream by 30% in the next year, by producing more Netflix Original movies (targeted to English vs. World Cinema, recommended age group and genre) and/or by acquiring the rights to stream already highly rated movies?
I have analyzed the data using Tableau and you can see the results here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/shira.balint6918

Thank you!
